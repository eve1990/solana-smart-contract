# solana resource
# smart contract
Solana's ability to run arbitrary executable code is part of what makes it so powerful. Solana programs, similar to "smart contracts" in other blockchain environments, are quite literally the backbone of the Solana ecosystem. And the collection of programs grows daily as developers and creators dream up and deploy new programs.

This lesson will give you a basic introduction to writing and deploying a Solana program using the Rust programming language. To avoid the distraction of setting up a local development environment, we'll be using a browser-based IDE called Solana Playground.
